I need to put something here, I guess...

If you plan on building the firmware, you'll need a few things.
--avr-gcc (Ubuntu's repo has this as 'gcc-avr' for some reason)
--avr-binutils
--avr-libc
--avrdude
--scons, which in turn requires Python

The SConscript/SConstruct files assume that you are using the avr-gcc toolchain and avrdude as your ICSP programmer.  You can modify the files if this is not the case.

Schematics are created with KiCAD.

Stuff in hardware/spice was made using LTSpiceIV.  This runs fine under WINE.
